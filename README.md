Data description:

MovieLens 20M movie ratings. 
20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users.
Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.

Collaborative filtering:
Using other similar user's preference, give recommended movies to users.

This project:

This paper utilizes three machine learning models to construct a recommendation system
in Movie dataset. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this paper. I
describe one of common issue in recommendation system: sparsity of data. I present
eï¬ƒcient algorithms to tackle this problem. I also discuss other algorithms to mitigate this
problem in the same application as well. Empirical results demonstrate the performance
of the models in movie ratings prediction.
